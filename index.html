                    <p>If you've ever missed a meal, you know how hunger can affect you. You can't concentrate, you become irritable, and you may even become physically ill. Every day millions of children in America go to school without a lunch. Now we can help.</p>

                        <p>My dad was laid off from work and we haven't had enough food for lunch every week. Thanks to Luncher, and a generous donor, my school provides lunch for me and others in similar situations. We even get pizza on Friday!</p>

                        <p>Without a proper lunch every day in school, my son started acting up. His grades were suffering, and his teacher said he may have to be held back. When our school administrator posted on Luncher, and the donations started pouring in, his behavior settled and his grades improved!</p>

                        <p>We had a lunch program for kids whose family couldn't provide a lunch, but the food itself was unappetizing and unhealthy. Now I can be proud of the food I serve, knowing it truly gives the kids the nutrition they need to get through the day.</p>
